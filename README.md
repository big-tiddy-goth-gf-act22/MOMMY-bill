Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that I was a simp. If I truly believed that I would ever be loved by letting women walk all over me, what incentive would I have to not become a 3rd tier twitch sub to my favorite female streamer in hopes that she would eventually become my big tiddie goth gf? Wouldn’t it be in my best interests as a simp to donate 1000 dollars to my queen so that I might receive feet pics? While I myself am not actually a simp, I see simping as a form of religion where rather than a traditional god or set of gods, your being of worship just so happens to be your favorite e-girl. This is why I find criticism of the simp lifestyle to be disrespectful. In this great country, one is free to practice and worship any religion they choose under the first amendment. Why is it so wrong that instead of donating money to a more traditional church, I choose to offer my money in worship of Pokimane? Criticism of simping is particularly aggravating to witness when it comes from liberals: is it not their dogma that all women should be treated as queens? And yet they criticize those who choose to simp for lacking self respect and chasing delusions of love in their worship of queens. This is classic leftist hypocrisy and it makes me sick.
